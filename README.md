# Event Administrator
The Event Manager application is designed and implemented using the `WindowsForms` technology with the application of the `Model-View-Presenter` pattern.

Each event in the application has the following attributes:
- Title
- Description
- Date of occurrence
- Type (work, family, entertainment, health, sports, other)
- Priority (high, medium, low)

The event collection is stored in `XML` files, ensuring efficient loading and enabling smooth manipulation and retrieval of event data within the application.

The GUI is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing events.

6. **Saving/Loading Events to/from File**: Events can be saved to and loaded from a file, enabling users to persist their data across sessions.
